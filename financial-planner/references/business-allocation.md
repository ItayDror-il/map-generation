# Business Owner Financial Allocation

## Profit First Framework

The Profit First method (Mike Michalowicz) flips traditional accounting:
- Traditional: Revenue - Expenses = Profit
- Profit First: Revenue - Profit = Expenses

**Core principle:** Pay yourself first, then operate on what's left.

### Target Allocation Percentages (TAPs)

| Real Revenue | Profit | Owner Pay | Tax | Operating |
|--------------|--------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| $0-$250K | 5% | 50% | 15% | 30% |
| $250K-$500K | 10% | 35% | 15% | 40% |
| $500K-$1M | 15% | 20% | 15% | 50% |
| $1M-$5M | 10% | 10% | 15% | 65% |
| $5M-$10M | 15% | 5% | 15% | 65% |
| $10M-$50M | 20% | 0%* | 15% | 65% |

*Owner pay at higher revenues becomes salary, not percentage

### Account Structure

Set up 5 core accounts:
1. **Income** - All revenue deposits here first
2. **Profit** - Business profit reserve (quarterly distribution)
3. **Owner Pay** - Your salary
4. **Tax** - Tax reserves
5. **Operating Expenses** - Business costs

### Allocation Rhythm

**Every deposit (or twice monthly):**
1. Total income account balance
2. Allocate percentages to each account
3. Only spend from Operating Expenses

**Quarterly:**
1. Distribute 50% of Profit account to owner
2. Keep 50% as retained earnings/emergency fund
3. Pay quarterly estimated taxes from Tax account

## Business Emergency Fund

Separate from personal emergency fund:

| Business Type | Reserve Target |

| Seasonal business | 4-6 months |
| New business (<2 years) | 6 months minimum |

## Owner Compensation Strategies

### Sole Proprietor / Single-Member LLC
- All profit is pass-through income
- Pay quarterly estimated taxes
- "Owner pay" is really owner draw
- No payroll tax savings available

### S-Corporation Election
**When beneficial:** Generally when profit exceeds $40-50K

**Strategy:**
1. Pay yourself "reasonable salary" (subject to payroll tax)
2. Take remaining profit as distribution (no SE tax)
3. Saves 15.3% SE tax on distribution portion

**Example ($150K profit):**
- Reasonable salary: $70,000 (payroll tax: $10,710)
- Distribution: $80,000 (no SE tax)
- Savings vs sole prop: ~$12,240/year

**Reasonable salary factors:**
- Industry standards for your role
- Time spent on business
- Revenue and profitability
- Comparable employee salaries

## Retirement Accounts for Business Owners

### SEP-IRA
- **Contribution limit:** 25% of compensation, up to $66,000
- **Best for:** Simple setup, no employees
- **Deadline:** Tax filing deadline (with extensions)

### Solo 401(k)
- **Contribution limit:** $23,000 employee + 25% employer = up to $66,000
- **Best for:** Maximizing contributions, Roth option desired
- **Advantage:** Can contribute more at lower income levels

### Comparison at $100K Net Self-Employment Income

| Plan | Max Contribution |
|------|------------------|
| SEP-IRA | $18,587 |
| Solo 401(k) | $41,587 |

Solo 401(k) allows $23,000 employee contribution + employer match.

4. Pay yourself (owner pay)
5. Review upcoming expenses

**Quarterly rhythm:**
1. Pay estimated taxes
2. Distribute profit (50% to owner, 50% retained)
3. Review YTD performance
4. Adjust allocations if needed
5. Meet with accountant if significant changes
